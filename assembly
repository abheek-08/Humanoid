### Step 1: Frame & Skeleton
- Cut aluminum extrusion to length (torso, limbs).
- Assemble base skeleton with CNC brackets.


### Step 2: Joints & Actuators
- Mount BLDC motors into joint brackets.
- Attach 3D-printed cycloidal gear reducers.
- Install encoders on shafts.


### Step 3: Sensors
- Mount RealSense camera at head level.
- Install side webcams for 360°.
- Fix IMU inside torso, load cells in feet.
- Wire microphones on torso.


### Step 4: Compute Core
- Install Jetson Orin NX in torso (with cooling).
- Mount Teensy boards near arms/legs.
- Connect CAN bus from Jetson → MCUs → actuators.
- Connect cameras/mics via USB.


### Step 5: Power
- Assemble Li-ion pack into modular tray.
- Connect BMS + safety relay.
- Install pre-charge circuit.
- Wire to 48V bus for motors + 5V rail for compute.


### Step 6: Hands
- Print OpenHand fingers.
- Thread tendons → connect to servos.
- Mount servos in forearm cavities.
- Attach tactile sensors to fingertips.


### Step 7: Software Setup
- Flash Ubuntu + ROS 2 on Jetson.
- Run motor test nodes via Teensy.
- Test sensors individually in ROS (camera, IMU, mics).
- Integrate into URDF/Gazebo simulation.
- Deploy same nodes onto hardware.
