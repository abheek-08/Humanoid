# HR-v1
Overview - We are building **HR-v1**, an **affordable, open-source humanoid robot** with a target cost under **$10,000**, accessible to students, startups, manufacturers, healthcare industry, and researchers worldwide.



## 🌍 Vision
Robotics today is dominated by billion-dollar labs and closed systems. HR-v1 changes that by being:
- **Affordable**: <$10K build cost
- **Open-source**: Hardware + software freely available
- **Capable**: Walking, manipulation, vision, speech, navigation
- **Efficient**: Smart power system with hot swappable batteries


If Tesla is building the **iPhone of robots**, HR-v1 is the **Raspberry Pi** accessible to everyone.
