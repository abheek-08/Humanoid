## üåç Vision
Robotics today is dominated by billion-dollar labs and closed systems. HR-v1 changes that by being:
- **Affordable**: less than $10K build cost
- **Open-source**: Hardware and software freely available
- **Capable**: Walking, manipulation, vision, speech, navigation
- **Efficient**: Smart power system with hot swappable batteries


Let's say Tesla is building the **iPhone of robots**, HR-v1 is the **Raspberry Pi** accessible to everyone.
